Documentation of what I learnt in the week-23rd to 29th march 2020

# GitHub Account
## What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online platform where people can share their codes on a particular project and get reviewed from others.Here,one can also see the work done by others on various interesting projects.
## GitHub Essentials-->
GitHub essentials consist of -
1. Creating repositories(organization of a single project)
2. Creating branches(working on various parts/versions of the same repository)
3. Make and commit changes(if one wishes to change any particular part of code or some statements )
4. Pull request(propsing your changes to someone else to get reviewed)
5. Merge request(merging the branch reviewed by others into the master branch)

_This is how a particular project can be made organized and working on it becomes simpler and more collaberative_

# Dual Boot Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10
I dual booted my Windows 10 OS with Ubuntu 18.IN
04 OS.
Ubuntu is considered as most secured open source OS and is most popular linux OS.
Ubuntu has preinstalled python IDE(Integrating Development Environment)
However,installation of PyCharm makes it more convinient for programmers to save python files and to work on them.
Along with python,libraries such as Numpy,Scipy and Matplotlib helps in writing programs of multidimensional numerical arrays,scientific expressions and plotting figures respectively.

# Markdown(Lightweight Markup Language)
Any files with .md extension are markdown files.Markdown language is extensively used to write files precisely.
Markdown Files are very easy to write and handle.It has its own cheatsheet to follow.Markdown is often used to format readme files,for writing messages in online forums,and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
